# McBride Creative - Business Context Document

## Business Overview

**Business Name:** McBride Creative  
**Owner:** Jason McBride  
**Location:** Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada  
**Industry:** Marketing Design & Social Media for Community Theatre

### Mission
Professional marketing design for community theatre companies. Helping theatres fill seats with designs that deserve an encore.

### Core Philosophy

## Target Market

### Primary Audience
Community theatre companies, specifically:
- Organizations with 4-8 productions per year
- Volunteer-run organizations with limited resources

### Geographic Focus

- **Service Area:** Theatres across Canada (online business model)
- **Initial Prospects:** Ontario and nearby regions

### Market Understanding
- Community theatres have tight budgets but pay for what they value
- They need help with marketing because they're typically volunteer-run
- Insider knowledge of theatre culture, season planning, subscription drives, audition promotion, and donor engagement is invaluable

3. **Professional Materials:** "Your productions deserve marketing materials as polished as your performances"

4. **Insider Credibility:** Two years with MCG, understands volunteer challenges, knows the culture

5. **Live Experience:** Marketing the irreplaceable experience of live theatre - the connection, feeling, and immersion that screens cannot provide

## Business Development Strategy

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Secure domain and all social media handles
2. Create logo in Canva (clean typography, professional aesthetic)
3. Build portfolio website showcasing MCG work
4. Document MCG work as case study with before/after and metrics if available
5. Define and price service packages
6. Identify first 10 prospect theatres (active on social, inconsistent graphics)

### Case Study Foundation
Musical Comedy Guild Sault Ste. Marie work serves as founding portfolio and credibility. Get "Designed by McBride Creative" credits on future MCG materials with their permission.

### Competitive Advantages
1. Insider theatre knowledge and cultural understanding
2. Technical background (systems thinking, deadlines, problem-solving)
3. Proven portfolio with real community theatre client
4. Understanding of both the art AND the business
5. Specialized focus (not general marketing agency)

### Growth Path
- Start with design packages (core offering, scalable)
- Add social media posting/scheduling as upsell
- Eventually offer full marketing strategy and execution
- Design deliverables are finite and concrete (easier to manage multiple clients than full social media management)
